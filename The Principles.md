# Learning vs Winning the System

### Shift from winning a system to long term learning. 

Such as:

1. In school, focus on improve myself instead of getting a good grade
2. In terms of working, join a group of people smarter than myself to let me grow, instead of impress my boss

# What is Success

Simply being smart is not the way to success. **Drive and Persistence** is the key.

# The Obstacle

When the time I feel I'm suck, that means im facing an obstacle that are the path that others abandon. Keep going! Failures can teach the hard lessons which makes them good opportunities.

# The Dip

Know when I should turn around. Sometimes the path might be a wrong pursuit for me. We have limited time on this earth. The path that we pick has to be a smart path.

# Compound Learning

复利学习, An idea from compound interest.

### Make small changes every single day.

"Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you're twice as good" -- Alan Weiss, Ph.D

Spend 20 minutes each day on focused learning (2h each week), over a lifetime will beat out anybody.

# Failures Don't Count

Everybody just remembers when I am currently. They don't remember my failure 10 years ago.

I can fail 100 times, as long as I success the 101 time, people don't see my 100 failure.

### Failures ONLY makes me learn and become better, and it doesn't COUNT at all.

# Choice vs Chore

Chore is something I have to do. i.e. I have to clean my dishes.

However there is no physical evidence to prove you didn't learn. 

### Make learning as my choice, I choose to learn every day for 20 minutes, instead of I have to learn like a chore.

Choice will always beat out the chore.
